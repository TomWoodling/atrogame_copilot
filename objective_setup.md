2. Setting up Objectives in the Scene:

    Create a Node or Node3D: In your mission scene (e.g., mission1_crater.tscn), create a plain Node or Node3D.

    Name it: Rename this node to match the objective ID exactly (e.g., M1_TalkChad2, M1_CollectCarbon1, M1_CraterExitButton).

    Attach Script: Attach the MissionObjective.gd script to this node.

    Configure Exports: In the Inspector, set starts_inactive and trigger_once as needed for this objective. You can leave objective_id blank if the node name matches.

    Add Child Trigger: Make the actual physical trigger mechanism (the Area3D for reaching, the StaticBody3D for the collectable item, the Button node, the CharacterBody3D for the NPC) a CHILD of this MissionObjective node.

    Connect Child to Parent:

        For Area3D: Select the child Area3D. Go to the Node->Signals tab. Connect the body_entered(body: Node3D) signal. In the connection dialog, select the parent MissionObjective node and choose "Pick Function". Select or type report_trigger_met. Add a check inside the Area3D's script (or a temporary script) to ensure body.is_in_group("player") before calling get_parent().report_trigger_met().

        For Interactable Nodes (NPCs, Items, Buttons that aren't Godot Buttons): These need a simple script. This script needs an interact() method (called by PlayerInteraction). Inside interact(), call get_parent().report_trigger_met().

        For Godot Buttons: Select the child Button. Connect its pressed() signal to the parent MissionObjective node's report_trigger_met method.

    Add to Group: Add the parent MissionObjective node (the one with the script) to the "mission_objectives" group (new group name).

Example Scene Structure:

      
▼ mission1_crater (Node3D - Root of Scene)
  ▼ M1_TalkChad2 (Node - MissionObjective Script Attached, In 'mission_objectives' group)
	▼ CHADstronaut_2 (CharacterBody3D - Actual NPC scene instance) <--- PlayerInteraction targets this
	  ▶ CollisionShape3D
	  ▶ MeshInstance3D
      ▶ InteractionArea (Area3D - for PlayerInteraction highlight)
      ▶ NPCInteractionLogic (Node - Script with interact() method) <--- Calls get_parent().report_trigger_met() in interact()
  ▼ M1_CollectCarbon1 (Node3D - MissionObjective Script Attached, In 'mission_objectives' group)
	▼ CarbonItem (StaticBody3D - The collectable item mesh/collision) <--- PlayerInteraction targets this
	  ▶ CollisionShape3D
	  ▶ MeshInstance3D
      ▶ ItemInteractionLogic (Node - Script with interact() method) <--- Calls get_parent().report_trigger_met() in interact()
  ▼ M1_ReachExitArea (Node3D - MissionObjective Script Attached, In 'mission_objectives' group)
	▼ ExitTriggerZone (Area3D) <--- Connect body_entered to parent's report_trigger_met
	  ▶ CollisionShape3D
