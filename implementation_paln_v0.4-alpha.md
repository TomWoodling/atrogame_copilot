Implementation Plan for v0.4-alpha:

    Scanner Interface

Key Features:

    Integration with our new input handling system via GameManager signals
    Categories align with inventory system and collectibles from design doc
    Visual feedback system for scan progress
    Range-based detection system
    Scan data storage and retrieval

    Environmental Object System

    Inventory Enhancement

Integration Points:

    Build on our centralized input system:

GDScript

# game_manager.gd additions
signal scanner_activated
signal scanner_deactivated
signal scan_requested

    UI Integration:

GDScript

# scanner_display.gd
func _ready() -> void:
    GameManager.scanner_activated.connect(_on_scanner_activated)
    GameManager.scan_requested.connect(_on_scan_requested)

Recommended Additional Systems:

    POI Manager

    Manages spawn points for scannable objects
    Integrates with chunk loading system
    Handles object pooling for efficiency

    Data Persistence System

    Save/load scan discoveries
    Track collection progress
    Preserve inventory state

    Achievement System

    Track first discoveries
    Count total scans per category
    Special achievements for complete sets

Implementation Order:

    Basic scanner interface and input handling
    Scannable object base class
    Environmental object spawning
    Inventory integration
    Data persistence
    Achievements

This approach:

    Builds on our improved input handling
    Follows the game design document's collectible system
    Sets up infrastructure for future NPC interactions
    Maintains efficient code practices
    Prepares for future terraforming mechanics

Would you like me to detail any of these systems further or suggest a specific implementation order? The scanner interface could be our first focus since it builds directly on our recent input handling improvements.
